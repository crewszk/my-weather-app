# my-weather-app
A Next.js React App developed in Typescript. A weather app that integrates the Weatherbit.io API for displaying the current weather of a specified location.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with React and Next.js as much as possible by completing a project from scratch. Its a simple web application
only using a handful of components that starts with a form which accepts either a zipcode or a State + City, though the zipcode takes priority. It will then search
for the current weather of that location via the Weatherbit.io API, which returns a JSON file of things like the temperature, wind, and a description of the sky.

This project covers topics including but not limited to:
- React.js
- Typescript
- Next.js
- AJAX fetch() calls to an API
- JSON parsing both local and through the API data
- Javascript/Typescript class structure and arrow functions
- Bootstrap and CSS

## A live version will be available on my portfolio website at [crewszk.github.io](crewszk.github.io once) I complete the website
