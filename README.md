# my-weather-app
A Next.js React App developed in Typescript. A weather app that integrates the Weatherbit.io API for displaying the current weather of a specified location.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with React and Next.js as much as possible by completing a project from scratch. Its a simple web application
only using a handful of components that starts with a form which accepts either a zipcode or a State + City, though the zipcode takes priority. It will then search
for the current weather of that location via the Weatherbit.io API, which returns a JSON file of things like the temperature, wind, and a description of the sky.

This project covers topics including but not limited to:
- React.js
- Typescript
- Next.js
- AJAX fetch() calls to an API
- JSON parsing both local and through the API data
- Javascript/Typescript class structure and arrow functions
- Bootstrap and CSS

## Future
I want to develop more web apps in React in the future that uses a more complex component structure than this one, and one project I had in mind was a generic e-commerce website that queries a database and displays items in a neat and dynamic fashion based on the search, as well as updating the search results based on filter criteria. I'm hoping to include a fully working shopping cart, user authentication system, profile + settings for users, a wishlist for users, recommendations based on saved tags from searches and buying practices, and it will all be built in typescript and Next.js React. This will also be uploaded to GitHub in time, I'm in the planning stages as of this commit.

## A live version will be available on my portfolio website at https://crewszk.github.io once I complete the website
